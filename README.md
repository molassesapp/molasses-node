<h1 align="center">Molasses Javascript Libraries</h1>

This is the monorepo for all things JavaScript and Molasses.
It includes both Node and Browser (with TypeScript support) SDKs for Molasses. It allows you to evaluate user's status for a feature. It also helps simplify logging events for A/B testing.

`Molasses-server` uses polling to check if you have updated features. Once initialized, it takes microseconds to evaluate if a user is active.
